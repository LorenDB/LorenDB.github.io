        <p>Welcome to WineForXP, a project to bring modern functionality to Windows XP!
            Our objective is porting the Wine project (<a href="https://winehq.org/">winehq.org</a>)
            to Windows XP, so that any modern Windows program can be run on Windows XP.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Why WineForXP? Isn't Windows XP dead?</h3>
        <p>Windows XP may be dead, yes, but there are still plenty of people who use it.
            Some use it for nostalgic reasons. Others have old software. And a 
            loyal few vow to never stop using XP for their daily driver.
        </p>
        <h3>How can this be done?</h3>
        <p>
            It may be possible to actually compile Wine binaries onto Windows, but it would
            require a vast modification to the source code, if not a total rewrite. Instead,
            I'm focusing on a slightly more Linux-based approach. I'm planning to base WineForXP
            off of <a href=https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a href="http://www.mingw-w64.org">MinGW-w64</a>. These 
            programs are designed to run Linux programs on Windows. For more information, please click on
            one of the links.
        </p>
        <h3>But how does Windows know to run programs with WineForXP?</h3>
        <p>
            Well, the short answer is "Windows doesn't". The long answer: WineForXP will include
            a program manager of sorts. Starting the program manager will give you a list of all
            of the installed programs. From there, you can run whatever you want. I'm not sure yet
            if I will write the program manager myself or if I will cop out and use/modify somebody else's
            program, but it will probably be the latter.
        </p>
        <h3>When will WineForXP be available?</h3>
        <p>
            Hopefully by the end of 2019, but definitely by the end of 2020. It largely depends on how much of my
            spare time I devote to WineForXP.
